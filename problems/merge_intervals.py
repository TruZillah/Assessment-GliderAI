Problem 5: merge_intervals(intervals) -> List[List[int]]
Merge all overlapping intervals. Intervals are [start, end] with start <= end.

Examples:
- merge_intervals([[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]) -> [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
- merge_intervals([[1,4],[4,5]]) -> [[1,5]]

Constraints:
- Return intervals sorted by start.
